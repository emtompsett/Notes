using group workflow - 
- use readme to document who is doing what and what they learn over the assignment.
- students have opportunity to self opt into teams - there is a max number of collaborators on a team and students have an option to join an existing team or create a new one.
- social features of using group projects - graphs, pulse, etc. helps show who is doing what when
- in settings -> collaborators & teams -> will show you who is in what group
- can use the same groups again
