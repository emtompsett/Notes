# Notes/Takeaways 
# SIGSCE 2017

## Friday Keynote
## Gail Chapman - ECS
* need to differentiate methods of teaching that include all students - in the examples, the language and the mindset
* try to break the biases of "you aren't from here/you aren't like me" and "you either have it or you don't"

## Converting your teaching to active learning via POGIL 
* refresher on POGIL

## GitHub Workshops
* notes on github - using pull requests to give feedback
* using branching and review to grade student work
* Git internals video John Britton
* Oreilly git video series

## Nifty Assignments
* http://nifty.stanford.edu/
* the lecture isn't where students learn - it sets the scene for the actual learning
* the assignment is where the students actually do the learning
* coming up with assignments is a lot of work - especially really thoroughly planned thought out one
### falling sand - http://nifty.stanford.edu/2017/feinberg-falling-sand/
* either with 2D arrays in Java or with jsut ifs and method calls - this tests everything about conditionals
* version online is without the 2D arrays
* wikipedia page called falling-sand game - not really a game, more of modelling
* all students implement the small core of functionality - metal, sand and water (earns a 90%)
* no instruction or suggestions given about what to do beyond the metal, sand and water
### 2048 in python - http://nifty.stanford.edu/2017/mishra-2048/
* has targeted help and instructional videos - very good in Intro to Programming - scalable for all levels of experience
* need to create swap
* variable types and assignments, loops(?), if statements(?)
* 4-10 hour at CS0, 2-5 hour at CS1
* focuses on abstraction 
### Fractal Sound - http://nifty.stanford.edu/2017/hug-fractal-sound/
* uses an interface - has one method that returns a double (and makes a sound)
* shows them an "arbitrary" shape and asks them to draw it - the sound acompanies
* last part is fractal sound - modify the sawtooth wave by bitwise and instead of mod-ing 
* this thing is awesome - definitely doing this at the end of AP.
* need 2 libraries - given in .jar files 
* need headphones
* how much do you explain bitshifting - use these magic symbols 
* why does it sound like that - no easy answer 
### Automatically Solving SAT/TOEFL questions - http://nifty.stanford.edu/2017/guerzhoy-SAT-synonyms/
* two words are going to by synonyms if they appear in similar contexts - use texts from guttenberg files
* rule based ai -> learning base ai
* can use vectors -> they need to know linear algebra - really cool math 
* need to develop reasonable testcases
* can do some algorithm design that is relativvely symbol - nested for-loops - but that takes a really long time
* use the storage instead
